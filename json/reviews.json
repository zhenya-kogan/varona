		"...the most punk non-punk thing I've ever heard!",
		"...haunting, poetic vocals, tribal rhythms, stabbing saxophone lines...",
		"VARONA combines elements of psychedelic rock and infuses it with improvisation and collective interplay. Comprised of rich unique instrumentation, VARONA juxtaposes unexpected combinations of colors and sounds which conjure up images of the mercurial flight of nature along with deep stirrings of the heart.",
		"VARONA â€” Local psychedelic folk punk jazz including a tuba and some fierce improv...",
		"VARONA's new drummer kicks some major ass. He is a perfect mix between funk and jazz with some tribal beats thrown in for good measure."
