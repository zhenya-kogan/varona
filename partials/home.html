			“A Part of Your Soul,” the fourth full-length album by Varona, has been in the making for almost a decade, and the songs that make it up have their origins further back yet and have gone through many transformations. For all their tendency towards experimentation, Varona take a very meticulous approach to songwriting, arrangement and production. The result is a work of precise weirdness. W.H. Auden once suggested that poetry be defined as a clear expression of mixed feelings. By that standard, “A Part of Your Soul” is nothing if not potently poetic, filled to the brim with emotional ambiguity and contradiction. The band’s stylistic influences are no less mixed than the feelings their songs evoke. Barely-contained anxious spasms of screamy post-punk; frenetic, cheerfully-destructive experimentation of Downtown jazz; literary melancholy of late-20th century Russian-rock songwriting, are not so much ingredients here as deep-set roots, and the result is less a cocktail than an exquisitely strange hybrid mutant not quite like anything else springing from San Francisco’s fertile musical soil.

			Varona was formed in San Francisco in 2005. Band’s line-up and instrumentation has been changing over the years. Currently, the band consists of Zhenya Kogan (vocals, guitar), Anya Kogan (keyboard, melodica, vocals), Rom Kuras (drums), Max Abelev (sounds), Mike Yeluashvili (bass) and Justin Chin (saxophone). Varona has performed at various festivals, street fairs and venues around San Francisco such as Rickshaw Stop, The Fillmore’s Poster Room and Neck of the Woods.

			On January 20, 2018 the band presented the new album at the iconic San Francisco club Bottom of the Hill with special guests, Bay Area’s legends Broun Fellinis.
