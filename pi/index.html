					Peralta Informatics is a software development workshop &mdash; we build high-quality tools and web applications. The focus of the company is on solid, scalable architecture, interface usability, and product correctness.
					<br/><br/>
					We have significant expertise across the technology spectrum, with particular emphasis on XHTML/CSS/AJAX techonologies, CLR (.NET/Mono) with C#, ASP.NET/XSP (C#), Python/mod_python application development, and server-side XML technologies (XML Web Services, XML RESTful services, XSLT, XQuery, and Relax NG).
					<br/><br/>
					We like Unix and have a deep knowledge of the GNU/Linux and FreeBSD operating systems.

						We accept work from design agencies looking to implement their online campaigns with quality, within budget, and on time.
						<br/><br/>
						We work with professional designers to provide end-to-end online solutions for businesses. Our approach fosters an unusual scenario where a technology team serves as a client to a designer, inhibiting overly-complex or otherwise unfitting design tangents.

						What sets Peralta Informatics projects apart is a compulsory agile software development process tailored for web application development. This process benefits from special tools developed in-house and published as open source.
						<br/><br/>
						We accept work related to designing, configuring, and improving custom software development setups: deployment automation, source control integration, text processing, XML processing, et cetera.

						That's right. We're in the process of dreaming about building a coffee shop on the first floor of our office &mdash; why not?

						Our coffee will be brewed in a cezve.
